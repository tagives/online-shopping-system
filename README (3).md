## 1. Overview

The **Online Shopping System** is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to simulate a real-world e-commerce experience.  
- **Customers** can browse product categories, add items to their shopping cart or wishlist, place orders, and submit product reviews.  

This project demonstrates core OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) and includes a clear GUI, modular service layers, and data persistence in memory.

## Project Report
**Introduction:**  
The system is designed as an object-oriented simulation of a modern online shopping environment. The main objective is to provide functionalities to customers.

**UML Design:**  
![umlfinal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/913bf6f8-582a-4c8d-a0a5-c1e7995b9cac)

**Methodology:**  
Encapsulation and inheritance were heavily used. Classes were modularized by responsibility (e.g., `user`, `model`, `service`). Java Swing was used for the GUI.

**Results:**  
The application simulates browsing, adding/removing products from the cart, placing orders, managing stocks, and customer reviews.
